# fMRI_python
 A set of scripts for my fMRI analysis. Still work in progress, I need to polish all the scripts and add more.
 
TODO:
	- plot_timeserie.py -> remove unnecessary lines. perhaps better to transform to functions just to visualise timeserie and compare denoising strategies
	- GroupKfold/RSA -> merge foveal and non-foveal
	- simulated_data -> remove unnecessary lines and write description
	- check notebooks..there might be something useful to add here
	- make a notebook with all the steps of my analysis?
	- perhaps i can break down the SVM script -> classify, cocktail-blank removal, map SPM betas, etc.
